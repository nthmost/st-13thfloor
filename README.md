# st-13thfloor
The "Stem Soul Compatibility Test" from the Wasted Space on the 13th Floor as a Streamlit app.

This app is deployed at http://text2gene.com:8501 with zero guarantees of workingness or uptime.  :) 

## What It Do

The Stem Soul Compatibility Test asks for your name, whether you are answering as an individual or as a group, and then four super basic questions that essentially boil down to a 4-factor version of the Big 5.

The questions result in a 4-digit "alchemical code" that is then applied to a flat-file database of creatures with personality codes of their own.  If there's a perfect match, that one result will show on the side panel.  If it's not a perfect match, you'll see two "nearest neighbors" to your code to choose from as your Stem Soul match.

## Installation

Make a python virtual environment and activate it.  For example:

    python3.7 -m venv ~/.streamlitve
    
...tbc
